# Movie-Recommender-Bot--Robocorp

Hi, i developed my own movie recommendation system in Robocorp, it would be a good example for intelligent automation. Here i had used the RPA+ML skills for deploying this process Here the robot will : 
1. Search the movie based on input from user 


2. Extract the Review from movie [ here i had used only ImDb website for sample demonstartion] 

3. Fed these reviews to sentiment analysis to analyse the sentiment and robot will finally say whether the movie is good or bad [either recommends, not recommends, or not sure] 


I had developed my own python library which use NLTK module to analyse the reviews............
